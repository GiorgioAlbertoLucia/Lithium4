# Lithium4
Analysis routine to search for Lithium4 from its decay products

## General pipeline
The analysis objects (i.e. the files containing both QA histograms and the input to compute the correlation function and the invariant mass subtraction) can be created by running preparation/prepare.py.
This script takes as an input the configuration file preparation/config/cfg_prepare.yml
